# RESTJerseyExample
Webservice for metric conversion:
Currently, project contains REST  services to built to convert Fahrenheit to Celcius temperatures and vice-versa.
A Client code exists in order to test the application.
Future, I would be adding more services for different metric conversions such as, cm <-> mm, ft <-> inches etc.
